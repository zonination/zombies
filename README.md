# How Dangerous is a Zombie?

## Method

Inspired by [this graph](https://scottkenemore.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/zombieguide.jpg), I decided to ping /r/samplesize to see if the Reddit hivemind agreed. Turns out, there's a slight difference with some movies, and a greater difference with others.

* Step 1: Gather data on which zombies Reddit wants to rate. This was the first survey I put on /r/samplesize. I instructed them to list as many popular zombie movies, TV shows, books, and video games as they could.
* Step 2: Take the 13 most popular zombies in fiction, and have /r/samplesize rate on speed, strength, and intelligence in a second survey. (All answers were optional, since not everyone has seen everything)
* Step 3: Some elbow grease with the code. In order to make the survey visually appealing and easy to answer, I had to let Google Forms leave the data in a somewhat messy format. Not to mention I had to perform the analysis on top of that. What I'm trying to say is, this was kinda fun.
